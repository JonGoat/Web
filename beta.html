        <p style="color:black;">
        I currently have done around 1 year in programming in python. I started off with python my sophomore year
        and learned a little bit but I started learning more attending East valley institute of technolgy. I've won some competions 
        while we learned to use VEX robotics.

            <p style="color: black;">
            Since I attend East Valley Institute of Technology, I've worked on many personal projects such as 
            a dice game, autoclicker, and much more. In addition, I made many other projects using pygame and tsapp
            that work efficently.
