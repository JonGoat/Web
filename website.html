                <p style="color:white;">
                I currently have done around 1 year in programming in python. I started off with python my sophomore year
                and learned a little bit but I started learning more attending East valley institute of technolgy. I've won some competions 
                while we learned to use VEX robotics.

                    <p style="color: white;">
                    Since I attend East Valley Institute of Technology, I've worked on many personal projects such as 
                    a dice game, autoclicker, and much more. In addition, I made many other projects using pygame and tsapp
                    that work efficently.

                <p style="color: white;">
                Some of the hobbies I have are really relaxing for me such as off roading. I like to go off roading a lot in my 
                rzr and go with friends up to the mountains and cruise. It's always fun to go off roading 
                because you meet new people and can enjoy the lakes and mountains. I also like to camp with my family and friends up in the 
                mountains too. My favorite hobby Sneakers.I have always been a passion for me so I collect a lot
                of sneakers.
